Remy, Jude and Connor 
Reflection
Jude and Remy worked very well together we finished our project rather qickly and we got the website to how we wanted it. Connor on the other hand did not do anything for this project.
I think we deserve 6 out of 8 for our project
We learned how to make a baisac webpage with a function.
We were focused most of the time except for when we finished the project.
